				<h1>&lt;Climate Change&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;Today there is an increase in climate change.<br>
					In this blog we will discuss what some of the social, economic, and political effects are happening
					in America.<br>
					We will also discuss how changing our impact to more green alternatives will help us in the long run.&gt;</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;What some of the more immediate impacts we will see from climate change is rising heat
						and other severe weather patterns whihc will harm people. Extreme heat will cause many
						people to die from dehydration while other severe weather could be harsh stroms that we
						have seen from huricanes in the Southeast part of America claim many lives.
						"In addition to physical injury, psychological harm including post-traumatic stress disorder,
						anxiety, grief and depression have been observed to increase following storms and other disasters
						As the intensity and frequency of storms and severe precipitation increase, ever more urban residents 
						will be at risk of injuries and illnesses that affect their lives and livelihoods."

				<section class="implication" id="imp-economical">
					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;A large impact that climate change will have on the economy is a rise is the sea level.
						Because the world is warming that means that each year the polar ice caps are melting, effectivily
						rising the level of water more inland. This will cause more flooding as current infrustructure cannot
						easily be made to combat the rise. Streets in coastal citites across America will flood casing millions in damage
						while real estate property will decrease and businesses and homeowners near the water front will leave at a loss.
						"Extreme events and slow-onset changes damage infrastructure and interfere with services necessary to industrial operation 
						including provision of electricity, water and sewerage. Sea level rise and associated erosion threaten coastal ports and 
						industrial areas [6, 7] and can raise salinity levels, changing the volume, timing and quality of surface water available 
						for industrial purposes [8]. For instance in Philadelphia (US) increasing salinity levels of the Delaware River could 
						negatively impact power stations, water treatment plants, food and beverage manufacturers and oil refineries [9]."

				<section class="implication" id="imp-political">
					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;We take a look at some of the political implaications and how they reach Americans.
						Quite a lot of Americans believe in climate change however many are divided on the trust of scientists and the impact
						that humans have on glabal climate change.
						From the pewresearch website there seems to be supporting data that there are big gaps among those on either
						spectrum of the two parties (Democratic and Republican).
						"Seven-in-ten liberal Democrats (70%) trust climate scientists a lot to give full and accurate information about the 
						causes of climate change, compared with just 15% of conservative Republicans."
						What this essentailly means is that democrats are more likely to believe in policy and individual issues that
						relate to climate change when scientists provide evidence than republicans.<br>
						This is an important factor to see because many politicians base several stances on climate change and push
						their own agendas on the public to gain votes. Such as creating
						alternative energy jobs or saying that traditional fuel sources and the jobs that come with it. Climate change
						has very much become a ploitical landscape that people try to exploit regardless of actually helping the enviroment.&gt;</p>

				<section id="conclusion">
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>&lt;So overall it is important for us to recognize the three main implications of what climate change will do to our lives in America.
						Not only from how much money will be lost in repair costs and idustrial relocations but also from the lives that will be lost along
						the way. Of course the political landscape is also changing as people debate whether they can trust what scientists have to say
						about climate change. Of course there will be politicians who will take advantage of personal and party beliefs on climate change.
						Regadless climate change is impacting us and in the future it may make a large impact on our lives. The question now is whether there
						is time to stop or slow the effects?
